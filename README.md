pong.js
=======

VERSION 1.x
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library was written to insert a game of 1-player playable PONG into
any web page without additional work. The only requirement for this
library is jQuery 1.11.0 (tested) though it likely works with jQuery 1.10
as well (untested).

CONTROLS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPACE - pause/unpause
Q - Move blue (P1) paddle up
A - Move blue (P1) paddle down
R - Reset game
ESC - Close game

COMMANDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To open the game window and start a game of pong, call
    
    PONG.start()

anytime within or after the document is ready. Example usage:

    $(document).ready(function(){
        PONG.start();
    });


BUGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a couple known bugs.
 - It's possible to stop the ball by sliding the paddle upwards as the
ball comes down towards the paddle. I thought I fixed this in a previous
version, but it seems to have come back.
 - The AI is version 0.2 alpha and as such, isn't always smooth
in it's movement.

Whether or not these bugs will be fixed in a future update is tbd.
